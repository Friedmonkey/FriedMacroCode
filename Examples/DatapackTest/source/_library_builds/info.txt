these are just library versions of the source files

i plan to make it so

!include <someLibrary>

will try to find like

someLibrary.fmh
someLibrary/main.fmc
../someLibrary.fmh
../someLibrary/main.fmc
%appdata%/fmc_libraries/someLibrary.fmh
%appdata%/fmc_libraries/someLibrary/main.fmc

libraries are just projects but the includes are parsed meaning it can fit into a nice single file, maby ill add other stuff later
